# DevOps Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using modern DevOps tools and practices. It includes:

- **GitHub** for source control
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines**
- **Self-hosted agent** running on a local machine
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **Kubernetes** (local deployment via Minikube or K3s)
- **Docker Hub** as container registry
- **Grafana** for monitoring and observability
- **AI chatbot** deployed as a microservice
 ** Trivy ** containter scanning.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in setting up scalable, automated DevOps workflows in a hybrid (local + cloud-ready) environment. It serves as a hands-on, self-contained portfolio to demonstrate:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Containerization and orchestration
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Monitoring and logging
- GitOps workflows
- AI service integration

> ðŸš€ This repo is intended for learning, demonstration, and technical validation of DevOps capabilities.
